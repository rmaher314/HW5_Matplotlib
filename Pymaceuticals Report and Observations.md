Pymaceuticals Report and Observations

Test set up observations:
   -  The test mice were pretty evenly distributed between male and female.  
   -  Among the drugs tested the test mice were pretty evenly distributed between all drugs with the exception of Campomulin and Ramicane.  Which were the drugs that showed the most promise.  These were the only drugs that both Mean and Median tumor size  at or just  and a Standard Deviation under 5.  
   - There does show to be some correlation between the Weight and Tumor Volume of around .59.  This data makes since the the mice overall weight would be impacted by the volume of the tumor because the tumor has mass and would have an effect on the weight.
